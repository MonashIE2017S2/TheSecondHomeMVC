                <p>“The Second Home” is a web based application which can be used by schools to potentially identify students who may fall into homelessness and provide information to teachers regarding support services currently available for such students.</p>
                <p>The 2011 census by Australian Bureau of Statistics(ABS) estimates that there are 105237 homeless people in Australia, of which 27% are under 18 years of age. Studies have shown that homelessness is damaging to the health and well-being of children, with constant mobility and uncertainty affecting their ability to learn and engage with school. Schooling and proper education is key to save them from the clutches of homelessness.</p>
                <p>The proposed web application which is aimed to be used by teachers in schools will lay down important indicators, that studies have shown to be directly or indirectly associated with homelessness in school going children, that can be used to identify any students who may be in need of assistance. The application will list out support services that are available for students. The application will also list some initiatives that can be taken up by school to help students who are experiencing some form of homelessness.</p>
